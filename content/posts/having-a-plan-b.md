## Why Are you talking about having a Plan B?

Because, if I've learned only one thing in my near 35 years on this planet, it's that life doesn't go the way you expect it to be, so you have to get into the habit of creating a plan B in case plan A fails on you. This really is the basis of Emergency Management. It's pretty much awnsering the question of "If this happens, then what do I do?". What's scary is that very few people don't do this, and as a result, it leads to disaster more often than not.

## Recent events have inspired me to this

Look. I'm not going to lie here, the state of the US election, what with Russia, the biggest Rechie country to be trying to push it in the Orange Hitler's direction, which is kind of ironic since it was a auth-left country, but nevermind, I suppose, there is a real possibility that Project 2025 could be a reality. If it happens, since it's not out of our immediate control, what do we do then? I've been asking for a while, and the scary thing is that very few can give me a response. They seem to choose suicide over fighting back or survival. To be honest, that scares me.

## So what am I doing about this?

As a first step? In all honesty? Securing my systems against them. I have a laptop that's running heads firmware and Qubes OS, which is a step in the right direction for safety. The compartmentilisation helps keep things apart. I have my flatpack games running in a different qube to internet access, say. It helps keep things safer. Plus I have signature verification and hashing of core files to protect them from tampering unless I update. I also deply Whonix as well. It's a good step, but it only works at the best level on certain hardware, and it might not be easy to get hold of in a good state. Then flashing the thing with heads can be a nightmare, with clips making it hard to keep connected onto the chip. It's not for everyone, and I get that.

## So now what?

I would say improve your security by doing little steps to make it harder for the Orange Hitler and his cronies to go after you, but sometimes, if someone wants to end you badly enough, they will eventually. Replacing some of your devices with lower-tech ones might be a good step. Sadly, I get the feeling that the Five Eyes will be more than happy to help the Orange Clod on his genocidal rampage.

It's depressing, really.

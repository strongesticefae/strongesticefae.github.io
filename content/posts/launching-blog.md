## How did we get here?

So, since the fall of cohost, I'm kinda left in a bit of a serious bind. Bluesky isn't fit for long
form posting, nor for sharing things more useful. Self-hosting is an option but.. I don't think my ISP
would be best pleased with me doing these sorts of things. So, I'm kind of stuck in with this. I know,
I hate it too, but it's much better than Wordpress or any other nugget nonsense I have to deal with.

So you're going to get more longer posts here, alongside rants, useful junk, and other random junk
that I can think of. I don't clam to be professional here, I just do it as I think of it. That's
all I can do, and I ask that you try and hold on to this. This isn't the best option, but I don't
think GitHub is going anywhere anytime soon, barring an existential event.
